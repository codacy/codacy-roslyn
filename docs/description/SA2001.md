# Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?

Empty critical sections of the kind

    mu.Lock()
    mu.Unlock()

are very often a typo, and the following was intended instead:

    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock()

Do note that sometimes empty critical sections can be useful, as a
form of signaling to wait on another goroutine. Many times, there are
simpler ways of achieving the same effect. When that isn't the case,
the code should be amply commented to avoid confusion. Combining such
comments with a //lint:ignore directive can be used to suppress this
rare false positive.
