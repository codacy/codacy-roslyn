# Don't use Yoda conditions

Yoda conditions are conditions of the kind 'if 42 == x', where the
literal is on the left side of the comparison. These are a common
idiom in languages in which assignment is an expression, to avoid bugs
of the kind 'if (x = 42)'. In Go, which doesn't allow for this kind of
bug, we prefer the more idiomatic 'if x == 42'.
