# Non-canonical key in http.Header map

Keys in http.Header maps are canonical, meaning they follow a specific
combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. Methods such as
http.Header.Add and http.Header.Del convert inputs into this canonical
form before manipulating the map.

When manipulating http.Header maps directly, as opposed to using the
provided methods, care should be taken to stick to canonical form in
order to avoid inconsistencies. The following piece of code
demonstrates one such inconsistency:

    h := http.Header{}
    h["etag"] = []string{"1234"}
    h.Add("etag", "5678")
    fmt.Println(h)

    // Output:
    // map[Etag:[5678] etag:[1234]]

The easiest way of obtaining the canonical form of a key is to use
http.CanonicalHeaderKey.
