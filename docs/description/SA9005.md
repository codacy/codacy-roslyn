# Trying to marshal a struct with no public fields nor custom marshaling

The encoding/json and encoding/xml packages only operate on exported
fields in structs, not unexported ones. It is usually an error to try
to (un)marshal structs that only consist of unexported fields.

This check will not flag calls involving types that define custom
marshaling behavior, e.g. via MarshalJSON methods. It will also not
flag empty structs.
