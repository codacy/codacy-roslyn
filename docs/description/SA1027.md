# Atomic access to 64-bit variable must be 64-bit aligned

On ARM, x86-32, and 32-bit MIPS, it is the caller's responsibility to
arrange for 64-bit alignment of 64-bit words accessed atomically. The
first word in a variable or in an allocated struct, array, or slice
can be relied upon to be 64-bit aligned.

You can use the structlayout tool to inspect the alignment of fields
in a struct.
