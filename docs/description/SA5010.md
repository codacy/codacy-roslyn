# Impossible type assertion

Some type assertions can be statically proven to be
impossible. This is the case when the method sets of both
arguments of the type assertion conflict with each other, for
example by containing the same method with different
signatures.

The Go compiler already applies this check when asserting from an
interface value to a concrete type. If the concrete type misses
methods from the interface, or if function signatures don't match,
then the type assertion can never succeed.

This check applies the same logic when asserting from one interface to
another. If both interface types contain the same method but with
different signatures, then the type assertion can never succeed,
either.
