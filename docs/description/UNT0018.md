# UNT0018 : System.Reflection features in performance critical messages

You should not use `System.Reflection` features in performance critical messages like `Update`, `FixedUpdate`, `LateUpdate`, or `OnGUI`.
Reflection can be slow and cause lags.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        var field = Type.GetType("foo").GetField("bar");
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Solution

If you must use `System.Reflection` to access a private member, consider caching results in `Start()` or `Awake()`, and use the cache in the loop instead.

In many cases, alternatives are available which don't require reflection. For example, if a game object has a private field referencing a UI component, a direct reference to the component can be obtained using code such as `FindObjectOfType<SomeGO>().GetComponent<T>()`; the component can be cached and subsequently directly accessed in the update loop.
