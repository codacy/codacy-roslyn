# Trapping a signal that cannot be trapped

Not all signals can be intercepted by a process. Speficially, on
UNIX-like systems, the syscall.SIGKILL and syscall.SIGSTOP signals are
never passed to the process, but instead handled directly by the
kernel. It is therefore pointless to try and handle these signals.
