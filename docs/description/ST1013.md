# Should use constants for HTTP error codes, not magic numbers

HTTP has a tremendous number of status codes. While some of those are
well known (200, 400, 404, 500), most of them are not. The net/http
package provides constants for all status codes that are part of the
various specifications. It is recommended to use these constants
instead of hard-coding magic numbers, to vastly improve the
readability of your code.
