# Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory

A sync.Pool is used to avoid unnecessary allocations and reduce the
amount of work the garbage collector has to do.

When passing a value that is not a pointer to a function that accepts
an interface, the value needs to be placed on the heap, which means an
additional allocation. Slices are a common thing to put in sync.Pools,
and they're structs with 3 fields (length, capacity, and a pointer to
an array). In order to avoid the extra allocation, one should store a
pointer to the slice instead.

See the comments on https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/24371
that discuss this problem.
