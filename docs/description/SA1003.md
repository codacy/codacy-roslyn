# Unsupported argument to functions in encoding/binary

The encoding/binary package can only serialize types with known sizes.
This precludes the use of the int and uint types, as their sizes
differ on different architectures. Furthermore, it doesn't support
serializing maps, channels, strings, or functions.

Before Go 1.8, bool wasn't supported, either.
