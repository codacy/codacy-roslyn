# Dot imports are discouraged

Dot imports that aren't in external test packages are discouraged.

The dot_import_whitelist option can be used to whitelist certain
imports.

Quoting Go Code Review Comments:

    The import . form can be useful in tests that, due to circular
    dependencies, cannot be made part of the package being tested:

        package foo_test

        import (
            "bar/testutil" // also imports "foo"
            . "foo"
        )

    In this case, the test file cannot be in package foo because it
    uses bar/testutil, which imports foo. So we use the 'import .'
    form to let the file pretend to be part of package foo even though
    it is not. Except for this one case, do not use import . in your
    programs. It makes the programs much harder to read because it is
    unclear whether a name like Quux is a top-level identifier in the
    current package or in an imported package.
