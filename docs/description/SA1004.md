# Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep

The time.Sleep function takes a time.Duration as its only argument.
Durations are expressed in nanoseconds. Thus, calling time.Sleep(1)
will sleep for 1 nanosecond. This is a common source of bugs, as sleep
functions in other languages often accept seconds or milliseconds.

The time package provides constants such as time.Second to express
large durations. These can be combined with arithmetic to express
arbitrary durations, for example '5 * time.Second' for 5 seconds.

If you truly meant to sleep for a tiny amount of time, use
'n * time.Nanosecond' to signal to Staticcheck that you did mean to sleep
for some amount of nanoseconds.
