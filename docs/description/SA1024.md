# A string cutset contains duplicate characters

The strings.TrimLeft and strings.TrimRight functions take cutsets, not
prefixes. A cutset is treated as a set of characters to remove from a
string. For example,

    strings.TrimLeft("42133word", "1234"))

will result in the string "word" â€“ any characters that are 1, 2, 3 or
4 are cut from the left of the string.

In order to remove one string from another, use strings.TrimPrefix instead.
