# Channels used with os/signal.Notify should be buffered

The os/signal package uses non-blocking channel sends when delivering
signals. If the receiving end of the channel isn't ready and the
channel is either unbuffered or full, the signal will be dropped. To
avoid missing signals, the channel should be buffered and of the
appropriate size. For a channel used for notification of just one
signal value, a buffer of size 1 is sufficient.
