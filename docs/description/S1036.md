# Unnecessary guard around map access

When accessing a map key that doesn't exist yet, one
receives a zero value. Often, the zero value is a suitable value, for example when using append or doing integer math.

The following

    if _, ok := m["foo"]; ok {
        m["foo"] = append(m["foo"], "bar")
    } else {
        m["foo"] = []string{"bar"}
    }

can be simplified to

    m["foo"] = append(m["foo"], "bar")

and

    if _, ok := m2["k"]; ok {
        m2["k"] += 4
    } else {
        m2["k"] = 4
    }

can be simplified to

    m["k"] += 4
