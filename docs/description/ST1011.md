# Poorly chosen name for variable of type time.Duration

time.Duration values represent an amount of time, which is represented
as a count of nanoseconds. An expression like 5 * time.Microsecond
yields the value 5000. It is therefore not appropriate to suffix a
variable of type time.Duration with any time unit, such as Msec or
Milli.
