# Importing the same package multiple times

Go allows importing the same package multiple times, as long as
different import aliases are being used. That is, the following
bit of code is valid:

import (
    "fmt"
    fumpt "fmt"
    format "fmt"
    _ "fmt"
)

However, this is very rarely done on purpose. Usually, it is a
sign of code that got refactored, accidentally adding duplicate
import statements. It is also a rarely known feature, which may
contribute to confusion.

Do note that sometimes, this feature may be used
intentionally (see for example
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3409ce39bfd7584523b7a8c150a310cea92d879d)
â€“ if you want to allow this pattern in your code base, you're
advised to disable this check.
