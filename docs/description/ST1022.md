# The documentation of an exported variable or constant should start with variable's name

Doc comments work best as complete sentences, which
allow a wide variety of automated presentations. The first sentence
should be a one-sentence summary that starts with the name being
declared.

If every doc comment begins with the name of the item it describes,
you can use the doc subcommand of the go tool and run the output
through grep.

See https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary for more
information on how to write good documentation.
