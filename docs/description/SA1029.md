# Inappropriate key in call to context.WithValue

The provided key must be comparable and should not be
of type string or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between
packages using context. Users of WithValue should define their own
types for keys.

To avoid allocating when assigning to an interface{},
context keys often have concrete type struct{}. Alternatively,
exported context key variables' static type should be a pointer or
interface.
